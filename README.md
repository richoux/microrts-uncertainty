## Compiling our bot

First, clone the develop brach of our GHOST framework with:
git clone --single-branch -b develop https://github.com:richoux/GHOST.git

Enter into the GHOST folder and compile it with the following commands (you need cmake and g++ or clang):
./build.sh
(on Linux, do not forget to run "sudo ldconfig" when the build.sh script finished)

Then, build the solver required by our bot:

$> cd problem_model
$> make all_rts

It  will  compile  and  place   the  executable  "solver_cpp"  in  the
src/ai/poadaptive folder where our bot is.

You can run the script "launch.sh"  to be sure everything is (locally) ok!

## microrts

microRTS is a small implementation of an RTS game, designed to perform AI research. The advantage of using microRTS with respect to using a full-fledged game like Wargus or Starcraft (using BWAPI) is that microRTS is much simpler, and can be used to quickly test theoretical ideas, before moving on to full-fledged RTS games.

microRTS is deterministic and real-time (i.e. players can issue actions simultaneously, and actions are durative). It is possible to experiment both with fully-observable and partially-observable games. Thus, it is not adequate for evaluating AI techniques designed to deal with non-determinism (although future versions of microRTS might include non-determinism activated via certain flags). As part of the implementation, I include a collection of hard-coded, and game-tree search techniques (such as variants of minimax, Monte Carlo search, and Monte Carlo Tree Search).

microRTS was developed by [Santiago Onta침칩n](https://sites.google.com/site/santiagoontanonvillar/Home). 

For a video of how microRTS looks like when a human plays see a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsKKAoiD7B0)

An AI competition was organized aroung microRTS in the IEEE-CIG 2017 conference, and again in 2018. For more information on the competition see the [competition website](https://sites.google.com/site/micrortsaicompetition/home)

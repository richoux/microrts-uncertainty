/*
 * GHOST (General meta-Heuristic Optimization Solving Tool) is a C++ library 
 * designed to help developers to model and implement optimization problem 
 * solving. It contains a meta-heuristic solver aiming to solve any kind of 
 * combinatorial and optimization real-time problems represented by a CSP/COP. 
 *
 * GHOST has been first developped to help making AI for the RTS game
 * StarCraft: Brood war, but can be used for any kind of applications where 
 * solving combinatorial and optimization problems within some tenth of 
 * milliseconds is needed. It is a generalization of the Wall-in project.

      Why having both domain and indexes vectors?

      The domain vector contains integers modelling possible values of a variable. Such values can be 
      {7, -1, 3}. Then, your domain can be not canonically ordered and have 'holes', ie, non-contiguous integers.
      Thus, it can be more convient for Variable objects to handle the index of their value in the domain rather 
      than their value itself. Indead, taking the next value in the domain is just incrementing the current index, 
      rather than searching for the next possible value in the domain.
      However, it is necessary to know which index is associated to a value, for instance for seting a new value 
      (in fact, a new index) to a variable. We had then two choices: searching for such an index in the domain vector
      or storing all indexes in another vector. For speed sake, we chose this second option.

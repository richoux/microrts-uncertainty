/*
 * GHOST (General meta-Heuristic Optimization Solving Tool) is a C++ library 
 * designed to help developers to model and implement optimization problem 
 * solving. It contains a meta-heuristic solver aiming to solve any kind of 
 * combinatorial and optimization real-time problems represented by a CSP/COP. 
 *
 * GHOST has been first developped to help making AI for the RTS game
 * StarCraft: Brood war, but can be used for any kind of applications where 
 * solving combinatorial and optimization problems within some tenth of 
 * milliseconds is needed. It is a generalization of the Wall-in project.
 * Please visit https://github.com/richoux/GHOST for further information.

   * In GHOST, many different objective objects can be instanciate.

   * You cannot directly use this class Objective to encode your objective functions since this is an abstract class. 
   * Yhus, you must write your own objective class inheriting from ghost::Objective. You can write different objective 
   * classes to model your problem, and switch from an objective to another between two Solver::solve calls.

   * In this class, each virtual function follows the Non-Virtual Interface Idiom (see http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill18.htm).
   * The only pure virtual function is required_cost. All other virtual functions have a default behavior implemented and are 
   * prefixed by 'expert_'. It is highly recommended to override these functions only if you know what you are doing.

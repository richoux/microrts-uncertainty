/*
 * GHOST (General meta-Heuristic Optimization Solving Tool) is a C++ library 
 * designed to help developers to model and implement optimization problem 
 * solving. It contains a meta-heuristic solver aiming to solve any kind of 
 * combinatorial and optimization real-time problems represented by a CSP/COP. 
 *
 * GHOST has been first developped to help making AI for the RTS game
 * StarCraft: Brood war, but can be used for any kind of applications where 
 * solving combinatorial and optimization problems within some tenth of 
 * milliseconds is needed. It is a generalization of the Wall-in project.
 * Please visit https://github.com/richoux/GHOST for further information.

     * This function is fundamental: it evalutes how much the current values of variables violate this contraint.
     * Let's consider the following example : consider the contraint (x = y).\n
     * If x = 42 and y = 42, then these values satify the contraint. The cost is then 0.\n
     * If x = 42 and y = 40, the constraint is not satified, but intuitively, we are closer to have a solution than with
     * x = 42 and y = 10,000. Thus the cost when y = 40 must be strictly lower than the cost when y = 10,000.\n
     * Thus, a good required_cost candidate for the contraint (x = y) could be the function |x-y|.
     * 
     * This function MUST returns a value greater than or equals to 0.
     *
     * \warning Do not implement side effect in this function. It is called by the solver 
     * to compute the constraint cost but also for some inner mechanisms (such as cost simulations).

     * \return A positive double corresponding to the cost of the constraint with current variable values. 
     * Outputing 0 means current values are satisfying this constraint.
